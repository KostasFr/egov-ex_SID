# Special Identity Card for homegrown Albanians

This website demonstrates a dynamic question-and-answer workflow for determining eligibility and required documentation for obtaining a Special Identity Card for Greek-Albanian diaspora (SID). It shows how user inputs can conditionally display additional steps and evidential requirements.

You can visit the web-based dialogue system [here][https://kostasfr.github.io/egov-ex_SID/].
